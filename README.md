# higher-order-syntax
An Agda library for signature-generic reasoning for "third-order" languages. That is, we have a base layer of "kinds", on top of which sits a layer of "types", on top of which sits a layer of "terms". The prototypical example of such a language is [System F](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_F).

Inspired by [SOAS](https://github.com/DimaSamoz/agda-soas) and [generic-syntax](https://github.com/gallais/generic-syntax).
